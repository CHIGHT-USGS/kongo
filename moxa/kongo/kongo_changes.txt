Fixed a bug, probably in the spectrometer that occurred with 
USB2000+ if the previous scan had an exposure time below 655ms
and the new one has a exposure time of 655ms or higher.
This is probably due to that the spectrometer internally counts
in hundreths of miliseconds and 65536 / 100 results in a different
timing mode inside the spectrometer. It was solved by checking for
this exposure time traversion and in that case, measure a spectrum with
only 1ms Exposure time before measuring the true spectrum.
The reason for why this solves the problem is not known but the
short spectrum probably forces a clean initialization of the
exposure timers inside the spectrometer.
(The change in code occured in the end of function sendExposureTime)

Fixed bugs that occurred with USB2000+ and when spectrum were transferred
with 32bits and when start-and stop pixels
were set in the configuration file. This caused the
data from the spectrometer to have some more datafields, and these
were not compatible with the older spectrometers. This resulted
in an invalid offset to the first pixel in these cases.

Date 2009-05-31
Modified code for dopulses and msleep to include changes done for the
Arellano-solartracker
in order to speed up stepping when using external stepper-motor controllers.

Date 2009-03-07
Added support for the USB2000+ spectrometer
Note: To use it you must enter
SPECTROMETERTYPE=USB2000+ in your cfg.txt file.

In that case the program will hange the Baudrate at startup with the K command
and will use 32 bits per pixel, if this is recognized in the returned data.

Note: Changing the baudrate will fail and will hang the spctrometer if
not subseeded by a poweroff of the spectrometers to return its internal
registers to startup state. Therefore it is not
possible to connect/unconnect the spectrometer to a running kongo program.

Fixes of the ftp-client in kongo.

Error 1: inet_addr() call was not supported by AXIS,
was replaced by gethostbyname.

Error 2: MSG_TIMEOUT flag was not supported by AXIS in recv() call,
was replaced by O_NONBLOCK flag in recv() call.


Date 2008-12-10
Removed call to GetCompass since compass is not used.

Date 2008-07-22
Added check that cfgstrato.txt exists before trying to use it.
Made sun calculation more similar to Beck-code for simplifying
future changes.

Date 2008-07-17
Added possibility to set parameter MININTTIME=
that define the minimum allowable exposure time.

Added possible parameter STRATOANGLE= and dedicated logic.
Notice: By default STRATOANGLE=5 is used.
If the sun elevation angle is below stratoangle then
cfgstrat.txt will be used instead of cfg.txt.
Sun elevation angle is approximately 56 degrees in the
summer in the middle of the day in Sweden and decreases
to 0 and to negative values at night.

Date 2008-05-12
AXIS version
GetCompass had temporarily been disabled by a return in GetCompass.
However this was done in an invalid way so that compass data read
from cfg.txt was overwritten.
since the float compassdir is assigned the return value of GetCompass()
This was changed so that compass is correctly read from hardware if
it exists. As usual, if the first argument of COMPASS= in cfg.txt is below
360 deg then these values will be used. Remember:a value above 360 in the
spectrum header indicates that
the result originates from true hardware compass.

A bug was fixed that caused kongo to read status.dat instead of cfg.txt after
a cfgonce.txt session.

Removed possibility to set temperature with the 4th argument in COMPASS=
since this causes confusion and is probably not used anymore.

Special Kongo_memoryfile version.
In this version, all files should be stored on A: and will be created on A:
The only files that will end up on B: is Uxxx.pak and Rxxx directories.
This requries changes in the NOVAC program.
THis version also requires changing TCPIMPEM=32 in chip.ini in order to
free RAM memory that is needed.

Date 2007-Sept-19
Included so that the box is rebooted if it tries to remove a file but fails because
the file is locked. After 100 such tries and fails, the box is rebooted.
This was done in the hope that it would fix problems with locked files during ftp
transfer.

Changes so that work.pak is stored on A: instead.
Therefore make sure you don't have any unnessecary files on A: that take space.
The files that should exist on A: is:

chip.ini
autoexec.bat
kongo.exe
tx.exe
ztrans.exe
extide.exe
cfg.txt
Of course there will now also be a file called work.pak on A: that is created
by kongo.exe.

This should not affect how the NOVAC program communicates with the Manne-box.

Date 2007-August-29
Changed so that cfg.txt is read from a:cfg.txt instead.

Date 2007-June-13
Changed so that the CPU clock is set every time a correct time is received from the GPS
instead of only at startup, as was done before.
This was done to avoid/reduce problems if the CPU clock is running at slightly wrong speed.
Incorrect behaviour with the time on a system at Tunguruha indicates that this could be the case
on some systems. Also changed behaviour at startup so that the CPU clock is set to the same time&date
as the STATUS.DAT file or the WORK.PAK file if any of these files exists. This is done before the
first polling of the GPS for time.
 
Date 2007-May-29
Added function at startup that checks if the current drive is B: when
kongo.exe starts. If not, it will automatically reboot after a delay of 10 seconds. This was done since it has been observed a few times that the driver for the CompactFlash sometimes fails to load, but will in such cases load after a soft-reset.

Date 2007-March-15
Added possible parameter REALTIME=2, this will tell kongo to behave in the old way when
renaming .pak files at startup and at the finish of a scan.

Date 2007-March-05
Fixed a bug that gave viewangle=270 instead of -90

Date 2007-March-05
Fixed a bug that caused the viewangle and viewangle2 in the spectrum header to always
be zero if SKIPMOTOR=1 was used.

Date 2007-March-04
The microcode for the PIC processor has changed (gps20_8_627.asm) so that when the ADC is read,
16 samples is summed and all bits are transferred to the SC12 processor. This will make the ADC
less sensitive to noise and this will improve the temperature reading a lot, it will also speed
up ADC reading since no averaging needs to be done in the Sc12 processor.  Both microcode and new
kongo.exe are backward compatible so older PCB versions will also work with the new kongo.exe but
will not take advantage of the new improved ADC precision and speed. The new microcode version
is 5, thus, DeterminePCB will report version 5 when kongo.exe starts up. All systems at chalmers
will be updated to the newest PIC microcode.

Date 2007-March-02
Added possible setting REALTIME=2, this will tell kongo.exe to not use the new
approach with the .pak files but instead use the old way of only storing in work.pak uand upload.pak.

Date 2007-Feb-27
Fixed a bug that put a space in front of the serialnumber if it was queried from the spectrometer.

Date 2007-Feb-26
To make wind-measurements possible with the Heidelberg-motor system, the repeat measurement
capability has been improved. This will go into effect if bit nr 3 in the flag is set i.e.
you should add the value 8 to your original setting of the flag field of your MEAS= line.
Then, the motor positions will alternate between the new position as given by the MEAS= line
and the position they had just before. The fields viewangle and viewangle2 in the header of
the spectrums will show the correct positions. Every even time, i.e. when the repetition
number is 0,2,4,6... (it starts at zero) it will have the new position, every odd time, 1,3,5..
it will have the old position. 
Here shows an example:
MEAS=   0   0 -1 2 1 256 sky      1  7
MEAS= 100 100  0 2 1 256 altenate 5  15
MEAS= 250 250  0 2 1 256 dark     1  7  
Notice that bit nr 3 is set in flag on the second line and is repeated 5 times. This will
alternate between position [100,100] (the new) and position [0,0] (the old, set by the first line). 

Date 2007-Feb-25
If SPECTROMETERTYPE=HR2000 it will try to change the baudrate of the spectrometer with the 'K'
command when kongo starts. This was required since HR2000 does not understand "x42 Baud 6" as
the old S2000 did.

Date 2007-Feb-25
Added possibility to use SKIPMOTOR=2. This will tell kongo to skip control of the internal
steppermotor controllers but to use external motorcontrollers as usual.
This was required to speed up motor-movements of the Heidelberg-system since feeding the internal
steppermotor controller with control signals takes unnessecary time then.

Date 2007-Feb-16
Fixed a part of the code that runs when kongo starts that gets the date&time from the files
work.pak and upload.pak. There was an error that blocked access to these files,
in some cases. This caused disastrous results in combination with the detection of a Full
CompactFlash since it started to delete one .pak file after another.
Is now fixed.

Date 2007-Jan-26
Added code to delete the oldest R--- catalog or if none exists the oldest U--- catalog
This is done if the COmpactFlash-card gets full.
Also added so that if the number of u---.pak files reaches 512 it will
make a new R--- directory and copy all U---.pak files there and start over again.

Date 2007-Jan-15
Changes the order things are done at startup.
Power is now OFF while the copying of u--- and R--- files.

Date 2007-Jan-13
Changed run----- to R--- where --- is now 3 digits hexadecimal (giving max 4095 values).
Changed u------- to u--- where --- is now 3 digits hexadecimal (giving max 4095 values).
As it was before, tx.exe and transfer.exe will have problems to retrieve files due to
too long filenames.


Date 2007-Jan-12
A new run----- directory will not be created at startup if there is no *.pak files.

Date 2007-Jan-11
Changed names for upload files
to u---------.pak where ------ are 7 digits that are increased for every
complete scan.
Old days are saved in run------ where ----- are 5 digits that are increased
for every day.


Date 2006-Nov-13

1. The ADC and the battery is now only sampled before the first MEAS= line.
This was done because it was not accepted that the reading of the ADC slows down
the measurements. The ADC is now also read 4 times and the average is calculated
in order to reduce the noise in the ADC reading. Reading of the ADC takes
approximately 1.0 seconds.

2. Changed the code to set integration time on the HR4000 so that it is done in binary
mode instead of ASCII mode, which makes the code more elegant and takes less time.
Notice: This is not tested yet!

3. Added code to preliminary support the USB4000.
You can now define SPECTROMETERTYPE=USB4000
Adding scans together inside the spectrometer should work, but is still
not working for HR4000.
For the USB4000, the number of added scans is not limited to 15 anymore
since the data is transferred from the spectrometer with 32 bits precision instead
of 16 bits (it is always 16 bits on S2000) if the number of internal summing is above 1.
Notice: Code is not tested yet since we have no USB4000 yet!

4. Added code to read the spectrometer serial number with command "?x0"
If successful, it will be stored as the instrumentname. To make use of this,
you should remove the line INSTRUMENTNAME= in cfg.txt

5. If the spectrometertype is HR4000 or USB4000, kongo will read the temperature sensor
located inside the spectrometer with the "?t" command. The value will be written in
the temperature field in the spectrum header. The sensor is only read before the first
MEAS=. If temperature is given as the fourth argument on the COMPASS= line, it will
ovverride the value queried from the spectrometer. Therefore, to use the spectrometer result,
only use 3 arguments on the COMPASS= line or no COMPASS= line.
